# The-Conqueror-Interview

I took the simplest approach for me to submit this task.

No php for including headers or footers (yes, that would have helped me a lot to break the pages even further)

I used vanilla css for the design. 

The JS approach is basic, saving the files in the globasl sessionStorage, and using that in the orders page.
