# The-Conqueror-Interview

I took the simplest approach for me to submit this task.

No php for including headers or footers (yes, that would have helped me a lot to break the pages even further)

I used vanilla css for the design. Only focused in desktop and mobile, no css for tablet view ( did not see it mandatory in the task requirements)

Loaded the items via Javascript

I generated the header, by appending the html inside the footer-script. I exported the logo as svg from figma.

The JS approach is basic, saving the selected in the global sessionStorage, and using that in the orders page.
